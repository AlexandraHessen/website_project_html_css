<div id="info_1"><p>Transportation and construction, along with their upstream manufacturing supply businesses, comprised most heavy industry throughout the industrial age, along with some capital-intensive manufacturing. Traditional examples from the Industrial Revolution through the early 20th century included steelmaking, artillery production, locomotive erection, machine tool building, and the heavier types of mining.</p>
    <p>When the chemical industry and electrical industry developed, they involved elements of both heavy industry and light industry, which was soon also true for the automotive industry and the aircraft industry. Heavy industry shipbuilding became the norm as steel replaced wood in modern shipbuilding. Large systems are often characteristic of heavy industry, such as the construction of skyscrapers and large dams during the post-World War II era, and the manufacture/deployment of large rockets and giant wind turbines through the 21st century.</p></div>

    <p>Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, with some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities. In some countries like Australia, it is common to call a factory building a.</p>
    <p>Factories may either make discrete products or some type of continuously produced material, such as chemicals, pulp and paper, or refined oil products. Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called plants and may have most of their equipment &mdash; tanks, pressure vessels, chemical reactors, pumps and piping â€“ outdoors and operated from control rooms. Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors.</p>

    <p>Combined cycle gas power plants or steam-gas turbine plants: these combine a gas turbine and a traditional thermal plant to generate electricity. Unlike conventional thermal power plants, the residual energy of the gases is used for another cycle. This is one of the reasons for which these kind of plants are more efficient by 56%, also meaning that they produce lower CO2 emissions than conventional plants.</p>

    <p>Solder is a metal alloy used to create strong permanent bonds; such as copper joining in circuit boards and copper pipe joints. It can also be supplied in two different types and diameters, lead and lead free and also can be between .032&rdquo; and .062&rdquo;. Inside the solder core is the flux, a material used to strengthen and improve its mechanical properties.</p>
